Android Malware Detection using Machine Learning Ensemble Methods
This repository contains code and data for detecting Android malware using machine learning ensemble methods. \n
Ensemble methods combine multiple machine learning models to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent models alone.

# Models 
This project evaluates the following ensemble methods for Android malware detection:
<ul> <li>Random Forest</li> <li>AdaBoost<li>StackingClassifier</li> <ul>

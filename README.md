# Android-Malware-Detector 
This is an Android application that detects if an installed app is malware or not, based on permissions and a machine learning model.

# Features
 <ul> <li>Users can select any installed app from their device</li> <li>The app extracts permissions data from the chosen app<li>Send a prediction request to the ML API</li><li>Receive and display the malware prediction result</li></ul>

# Machine learning model
This project evaluates the following ensemble methods for Android malware detection:
<ul> <li>Random Forest</li> <li>AdaBoost<li>StackingClassifier</li></ul>
  
# Machine learning API
The pretrained ML model is deployed as a REST API using Flask web framework.
It is hosted on Heroku to be available for the Android app.

The API endpoint takes in a JSON payload of app permissions and returns a JSON response with the malware prediction.
